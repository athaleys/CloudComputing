Platform as a Service (PaaS) that runs on a single server which helps
build and manage the lifecycle of applications. It is powered by
Docker and can be installed on any hardware. Dokku requires minimum of
1GB memory and Ubuntu 16.04 x64, Ubuntu 14.04 x64, Debian 8.2 x64 or
CentOS 7 x64 for the installation. It supports application deployment
through git. Technically Dokku is a set of scripts which combined as
build pipeline. It takes input as code and generates running
application. It aims to provide simple, hackable build environment to
quickly deploy code to cloud and make deployment easy so that
developer can concentrate on the application coding
